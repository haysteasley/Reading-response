            The Critical Atlas of the INternet gave me a brand new perspective on how the Internet is visualized. I had never thought about the geography of the internet, let alone on a worldwide scale. The proprietaary nature of the internet does not come as a surprise, and I was interested in how companies such as Google, Facebook, and ICANN have such monopolies over certain areas of the internet. I'm curious about the breadth of the Internet- given that the US makes up for most of the internet space. What does the internet look like n a place such as Morocco? Is it slower, less extensive? 

            I am also curious on the purpose of the Internet today. How has it changed since theinernet was first introduced and still open to interpretation? Back in the day, it seemed to have been decentralized and individualistic. People would use the internet for a specific purpose, such as research and getting an answer to a question. A single and short voyage. These days, the Internet seems to have become a destination itself. People surf the internet just to simply do it. And the internet / social media companies thrive off of that usage and data. "On the free internet, we are not the clients but the products; we pay for online services by letting our digital personality be absorbed through the surface of the internet." </p>
